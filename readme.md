Veredict: I really like the material this course presents but I dislike the way it is presented. All in all, recommended, but it would be so nice if it were better taught! I recommend going over it quickly, the exercises are trivial...

Cons: 
* My main criticism is that there is nothing in the course particularly challenging or difficult, and yet, because no effort is made to explain the whys and wherefores of design decisions or provide useful analogies to Mathematics or other programming languages, the whole thing feels as arcane and dense as reaidng the Bible in Latin. Perhaps newer iterations of the course could do what so many other CS lecturers do: show code with bad design decisions or bad comments and then address the problems as a way to build understanding of why the system works the way it does. 
* I felt recursive list functions were particularly badly taught compared to the Andy Balaam lectures on Youtube, or Dan Grossman of the 'Programming Languages' UoW course. 
* In summary, the course often requires students make connections by themselves or rote learn the material. I feel if I had had less programming experience than I have I would have probably quit out of boredom.
* Exercises are in Racket, but little effort is made to explain the different libraries in the language. 
* Too much copy & paste this recipe/template and too little explaining why the recipes are the way they are so we can remember them in 5 years or implement something similar when confronted with slightly different data structures.

Pros:
* Having said that, I still feel Systematic Program Design is worthy of study, and, seeing as there are no other MOOCs that cover this area, being patient and watching a sped up version of this course is worth it. I felt a lot more confident in my ability to plan and write maintainable, long term code after taking it.
* The material after week 7 is a lot better than the first half of the course.
* I also felt the example/test + template approach to writing functions as well as 'wishlists' and working backwards are very effective techniques for problem solving.
* The template approach seemed dumb at first but turned out to be a very good introduction to macros. I've already felt I write code differently, with more and better comments. 
* Before taking this course I would often write dummy versions of interfaces before adding functionality, but I never considered this as part of a broader workflow alongside tests. A large part of the course is coming up with clear examples and specifications, and it was very instructive to see this workflow over and over.
